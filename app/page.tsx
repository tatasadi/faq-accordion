            <AccordionItem title="What is Frontend Mentor, and how will it help me?">
              Frontend Mentor offers realistic coding challenges to help
              developers improve their frontend coding skills with projects in
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s suitable for all levels and ideal
              for portfolio building.
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem title="Is Frontend Mentor free?">
              The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that
              are premium and require a Pro subscription to access. It will say
              on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy
              to tell the difference.
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem title="Can I use Frontend Mentor projects in my portfolio?">
              Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your
              portfolio. Helping developers add professional-looking projects to
              their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem title="How can I get help if I'm stuck on a challenge?">
              The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
              Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there,
              so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated
              "help" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite
              to our Discord server here.
